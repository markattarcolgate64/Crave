This is Crave! An application that finds the food that you're craving and the restaurants with those dishes!

The app allows you to adjust what kind of flavors and cuisine 
you want and then gives you a bunch of dishes that match what you're craving. 

You can swipe on which one that you want, and then the app shows you a bunch of restaurants in your area or whatever area you choose 
that have dish and kind of food that you wanted. 

We plan to launch on the Google Play first and the App Store in the new future.

We also plan to add recipe finding as a feature as well.
